# Dice-Roller
Simple dice roller program based in the console.

## How to Use
1. Unzip the _DiceRoller.zip_ file
2. Open _Dice Roller.exe_
3. Choose which dice to roll. The number is how many sides the dice has (i.e. if the dice is dx, the dice will have _x_ sides)
4. If you picked the d20 you will be prompted to pick a DC. A DC is a number that determines whether you pass or fail (i.e. if your DC is _15_, and you roll _15+_, you will pass, if you get _lower_ than _15_, you will fail) If you do not want a DC, simply input _0_
5. Choose whether you want to add a number to your roll.
6. Choose whether you want to have advantage or disadvantage. Advantage is when you roll two numbers and pick the higher one, while disadvantage is the opposite.
7. You will now be shown your roll!
8. If you want to roll again, input any key. If you want to close the program, you can close it using the window manager, or by inputting _exit_ into the terminal.
